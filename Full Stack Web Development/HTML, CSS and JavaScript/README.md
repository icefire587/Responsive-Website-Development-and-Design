The Task 

This assessment task requires you to make an interactive game. Please see the accompanying video for an example walk-through. Some of the skills in this assessment task are demonstrated in the Example DOM Project, and the code for that project has been released in the system. You are recommended to look at that project and understand it prior to starting this assessment task.  

When the game starts, five faces are shown on the left and four are shown on the right. This is illustrated below.
